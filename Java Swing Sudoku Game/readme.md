# Sudoku Game

## Description
This is a Java-based Sudoku game with a graphical user interface (GUI). The game provides an interactive way to play Sudoku, complete with features like timer tracking, input validation, and visual feedback. This entire project, including the code and this README, was generated by Claude, an AI assistant.

## Features
- Graphical user interface for easy interaction
- Randomly generated Sudoku puzzles
- Real-time input validation with visual feedback
- Timer to track how long you've been playing
- "New Game" button to start a fresh puzzle at any time
- Congratulatory message upon successful completion of the puzzle

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or higher

## Setup and Running the Game
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system. You can check by running `java -version` in your terminal or command prompt.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sudoku-game.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd sudoku-game
   ```

4. Compile the Java file:
   ```
   javac -source 1.8 -target 1.8 SudokuGameGUI.java
   ```

5. Run the game:
   ```
   java SudokuGameGUI
   ```

## How to Play
1. When you run the game, a Sudoku board will be generated automatically.
2. Click on any empty cell and type a number from 1 to 9.
3. If the number is valid (doesn't conflict with the same number in the row, column, or 3x3 box), it will be accepted.
4. If the number is invalid, the cell will be highlighted in yellow with red text.
5. Continue filling in numbers until you complete the puzzle.
6. The timer at the bottom of the window shows how long you've been playing.
7. Click "New Game" at any time to start a fresh puzzle.
8. When you successfully complete the puzzle, a congratulatory message will appear with your completion time.

## Code Structure
The entire game is contained in a single Java file: `SudokuGameGUI.java`. This file includes:
- The main game logic
- GUI components
- Sudoku generation algorithm
- Input validation
- Timer functionality

## Customization
You can customize various aspects of the game by modifying the `SudokuGameGUI.java` file:
- Change the number of pre-filled cells by modifying the `count` variable in the `removeDigits()` method.
- Adjust the game's appearance by modifying the colors and fonts used in the GUI components.
- Modify the congratulatory message or add additional features as desired.
