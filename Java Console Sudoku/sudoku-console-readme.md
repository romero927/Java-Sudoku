# Console-based Sudoku Game

## Description
This is a Java-based Sudoku game that runs in the console. It provides an interactive way to play Sudoku with features like puzzle generation, input validation, and a timer. This entire project, including the code and this README, was generated by Claude, an AI assistant.

## Features
- Console-based user interface
- Randomly generated Sudoku puzzles
- Real-time input validation
- Timer to track how long you've been playing
- Option to start a new game at any time
- Congratulatory message upon successful completion of the puzzle

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or higher

## Setup and Running the Game
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system. You can check by running `java -version` in your terminal or command prompt.

2. Save the provided Java code in a file named `SudokuGame.java`.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `SudokuGame.java`.

4. Compile the Java file:
   ```
   javac SudokuGame.java
   ```

5. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   java SudokuGame
   ```

## How to Play
1. When you run the game, a Sudoku board will be generated and displayed in the console.
2. The game will prompt you to enter a row (1-9), column (1-9), and value (1-9) for each move.
3. If the number is valid (doesn't conflict with the same number in the row, column, or 3x3 box), it will be placed on the board.
4. If the number is invalid, you'll receive an error message and be prompted to try again.
5. Continue filling in numbers until you complete the puzzle.
6. The timer at the bottom of the console shows how long you've been playing.
7. Type '0' for the row when prompted to start a new game.
8. When you successfully complete the puzzle, a congratulatory message will appear with your completion time.

## Code Structure
The entire game is contained in a single Java file: `SudokuGame.java`. This file includes:
- The main game logic
- Console-based user interface
- Sudoku generation algorithm
- Input validation
- Timer functionality

## Customization
You can customize various aspects of the game by modifying the `SudokuGame.java` file:
- Change the number of pre-filled cells by modifying the `count` variable in the `removeDigits()` method.
- Adjust the difficulty by changing the puzzle generation algorithm.
- Modify the congratulatory message or add additional features as desired.
